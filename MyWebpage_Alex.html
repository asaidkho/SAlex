		<div id="history" style="width: 55%; float:right">
			<p> Pavel Durov launched the Telegram project. The idea was given to him by Western colleagues. Telegram is an analog of the messenger bought by Facebook for $19B. Basically, Telegram is an analog of any instant messenger service, but nowadays it has its own unique features. Thus, this project was the final straw, and relations between UCP and Durov had fallen apart once and for all. According to Durov, Telegram was created independently. On the other hand, according to the investment fund it was developed using VKontakte resources.</p>
			<p>The main feature of Telegram is its unique technology for data encryption, which increases the security of the resource by several times. You may remember all the conflicts related to the security issues of multiple social networks. Therefore, Telegram has become a truly unique platform, bearing in mind the experience of other social media, without repeating their mistakes. Several times, the Russian government demanded to block the network and give encryption keys to law enforcement agencies. Despite the fact that Durov tried to explain the features of the site and that even if they gave out the keys, the authorities would not be able to get access to the chats of users, the Government continued terrorizing the messenger.</p>
			<p>Due to the Telegram creator&#39s refusal to give the keys, Russia launched a large-scale information attack on Telegram and Durov himself. The news constantly repeated that the site promoted the spread of terrorism and was used for terrorism-related and drug dealers&#39 correspondence. In April 2018, the Government officially banned Telegram all over the Russian Federation. At the beginning of 2018, Durov announced the Gram cryptocurrency (TON token). He launched ICO and raised no less than $850M. At the second stage, he raised about $2B. This is several times more than the amount of all ICOs that were launched in 2017.</p>
			<p>Ironically, Telegram has become popular abroad due to this scandal. The project attracted financing through an ICO, as we&#39ve mentioned above, and now this process is not regulated by securities law. The MIT Technology Review magazine published a review, and said that Telegram is a brave startup, but it still needs some new ideas. Telegram promises to solve all the problems that hinder the development of blockchain technology at this stage, but does not explain how.</p>

	<ol style="font-size: large;"><i>
		<li>You need to become a pro in what you like and that will make you much happier</li>
		<li>Leave the garbage that you eat, drink, and smoke. Do not look for a magic diet, and consume only organic vegetables, fruits, and water.</li>
		<li>Being vegetarian is not the key to success, as well as a decision to refuse alcohol. You just have to know your limits.</li>
		<li>Learn foreign languages, so you will expand the boundaries of your perception of society. In addition, you will discover impressive career opportunities and personal development.</li>
		<li>Read self-improvement books and everything related to your professional activity. Audiobooks can be a good alternative to reading if you are too lazy to read.</li>
		<li>Make each day off a useful one. Spend time with your family, go to the cinema, go on a picnic, buy lunch for the needy. In a few words, expand the scope of contacts with the world.</li>
		<li>No matter what you write about and how laconic your writings will be. It doesn&#39t matter how many people read it, even if it is only your diary. The most important thing is that you will learn to talk to yourself.</li>
		<li>Set goals and unconditionally describe them in a notebook/diary/blog. Your ideas have to be concrete, measurable, and time-based.</li>
		<li>Learn to type without looking at the keyboard. Time is the most valuable thing you have, so you should think about what you are writing about, not about the location of the letter. Decisions have to be quick, and actions immediate; don&#39t put things off for later.</li>
		<li>Spend as little time as possible watching TV, &#34hanging out&#34 on the internet, and playing games. The same rule applies for social networks.</li></i>
